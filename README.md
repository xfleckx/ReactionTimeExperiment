# ReactionTimeExperiment
A Unity3D project showing the usage of an Arduino as a simple response box to measure response time to changing colors.

The Unity project contains a sample scene showing a simple response task to changing colors.
It uses the serial port emulation for communicating with the Arduino.
Using a Arduino Uno and it's interrupts to build a one button response box. 

## Experiment

Press as fast as possible the Button whenever you see the pink sphere.

## Features

* Provide a minimalistic implementation of an Experiment
* Writing Data as a CSV file
* Communicate through the serial port with an Arduino
* Use the Logic of the Arduino to measure response times.
