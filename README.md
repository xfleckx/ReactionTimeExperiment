# ReactionTimeExperiment
A Unity3D project showing the usage of an  arduino as a simple response box to measure response time to changing colors.

The Unity project contains a sample scene showing a simple response task to changing colors.
It uses the serial port emulation for communicating with the Arduino.
Using a Arduino Uno and it's interrupts to build a one button response box.
